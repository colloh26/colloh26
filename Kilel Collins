Kilel Collins here, a Cross Platform Developer with a focus on Front End Web Development who is now working toward earning his Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. 
I take pleasure in making contributions to open-source projects, and I have a strong interest in acquiring new technological skills.
I am now proficient in the languages React, Flutter, and Typescript. 
I become knowledgeable in SASS, Next.js, and PWA. In addition to beginning this blog, I also began freelancing.
Outside of the realm of information technology, I also enjoy challenging myself to learn new abilities such as break dancing and playing the piano.
Despite the fact that it has been quite some time since I've gone anywhere, I still enjoy traveling as well as playing football.
